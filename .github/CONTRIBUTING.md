If you'd like to add a feature or report a bug in the project, please open an issue, and be sure to write a detailed description describing the feature/bug and include whether or not you will be resolving it yourself.

## Guidelines:

- Prepend branches with `fix/`, `feature/`, or `docs/` following the [git-flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) branching strategy.
- All PRs are to be made to the `develop` branch prior to pulling into `master`.
- All linting/tests must run without failure for a PR to be merged.
- Please be sure to reference the issue # you are resolving/working on in your pull request.

If you have any questions feel free to reach out to one of the maintainers
